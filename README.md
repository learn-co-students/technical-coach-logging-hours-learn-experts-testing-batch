# Logging Hours

Any worked hours should be logged in Workday. To log your hours, [log into WeWork via the OneLogin portal](https://wework.onelogin.com/login). From the dashboard, select `Workday`. Once Workday loads, select the `Time` option. From there, you can add and submit your hours for approval.

Be sure to submit your hours *before* 11:59PM on the Saturday at the end of the work week - otherwise, they may not be included in the current pay cycle. Best practice is to log your hours immediately after the end of your shift so you don't forget, but it's not mandatory.

You are also able to log time for any meetings or extra work that you perform. If you are unsure if your time spent on a meeting or a non Technical Coach task (AAQ, Study Groups Portfoio Support) is loggable, reach out to your Technical Coach Lead and/or the Technical Coach Manager.

**For any issues regarding logged hours or payments, *email* the Technical Coach Manager: [ruth.mesfun@flatironschool.com](mailto:ruth.mesfun@flatironschool.com)**
